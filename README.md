# trading-decision-optimisation
 AI and ML based method to assign weights to trading conditions across diverse financial sectors like Equities, Futures, Options, Bonds, and Cryptocurrencies.

 The aim is to enhance the toolkit for traders, refining decision-making processes. Initial tests have been encouraging, suggesting this could be a step forward in supporting informed trading strategies.

Credit: My project greatly benefits from a range of tools: [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) for gathering data, [TA-Lib](https://github.com/TA-Lib/ta-lib-python) and pandas for data handling, [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for creating visuals, [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for number crunching, [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for neural networks, and [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) with [imblearn](https://imbalanced-learn.org/) for advanced modeling. These tools have been crucial in supporting the project's goals.


This graph depicts the Random Forest algorithm's test accuracy at the conclusion of the project. The overall code is based on a series of algorithms in both AI and ML domains, but this graph provides an overview of the results.
