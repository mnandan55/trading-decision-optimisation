# trading-decision-optimisation
 AI and ML based method to assign weights to trading conditions across diverse financial sectors like Equities, Futures, Options, Bonds, and Cryptocurrencies.

 The aim is to enhance the toolkit for traders, refining decision-making processes. Initial tests have been encouraging, suggesting this could be a step forward in supporting informed trading strategies.

Credit: My project greatly benefits from a range of tools: yfinance for gathering data, TA-Lib and pandas for data handling, Matplotlib for creating visuals, NumPy for number crunching, and Scikit-learn with imblearn for advanced modeling. These tools have been crucial in supporting the project's goals.
